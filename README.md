DESCRIPTION:   The uploaded design is a part of an Augmented Reality (AR) user interface mockup created in Figma for the application Stashify — A Digital Collection Space. This AR application allows users to interactively explore and showcase digital items such as NFT art, greeting cards, creative media, and bookmarks in a visually immersive environment. The purpose of this mockup is to demonstrate how intuitive design and AR interaction principles can be combined to create a user-friendly and engaging experience.

The design opens with a clean, modern landing interface, structured to guide the user effortlessly through the app’s primary functions. The top navigation menu includes tabs like home, explore, wishlist, and community, which are common in digital collection platforms. These tabs are placed to help users easily navigate through different sections of the app and engage with both their personal collections and community content.

On the left side of the interface, a welcome message provides a clear and brief explanation of the app’s purpose. This immediately informs the user about what Stashify does—helping them collect, organize, and present digital content in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Below the welcome message, two CTA buttons — "Explore" and "How it works" — invite the user to either jump straight into viewing digital collections via AR or understand how the platform functions.

On the right-hand side, a featured digital card or AR greeting asset is presented. This sample card, named Neon lemma, includes a visual avatar image, a price (1.5 ETH), and artist credits. In a real AR environment, this asset could be visualized in 3D or appear through scanning a greeting card using the device camera.

This mockup reflects principles of AR UI design, such as minimal clutter, clear navigation, engaging visuals, and interaction readiness. It aligns well with the requirements of Codtech Task-4, showcasing both creativity and user-centered design in an AR context.
